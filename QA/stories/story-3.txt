I recently had a thoroughly frustrating experience with Planet Stiffness. Despite cancelling my gym membership well within the stipulated notice period, I was shocked to find that they continued to charge me for several months. This blatant disregard for my request and hard-earned money has left me deeply disappointed. After cancelling my membership in writing and following the cancellation policy to the letter, I believed my gym-related woes were over. To my dismay, I discovered that Planet Stiffness had continued to withdraw monthly fees from my account, without any notification or explanation.

My attempts to resolve this issue through customer service were met with indifference and bureaucratic runarounds. It's astonishing how easy it was for them to take my money, yet how difficult it has been for them to return it. This experience has not only resulted in an unnecessary financial burden, but it has also left a sour taste in my mouth regarding Planet Stiffness's integrity and commitment to customer satisfaction.
