Six friends, Hary, Megan, Julie, Paul, Katy, and Alonso, ventured into a decrepit mansion rumored to be haunted. Their curiosity overpowered their fears as they stepped inside, flashlights in hand. The creaking floorboards seemed to greet them with ghostly whispers, and a chill hung in the air. As they explored, they realized the house was playing tricks on them. Hallways shifted, and doors led to different places each time they tried them. Panic set in when they realized they were trapped, with no way out. Desperation grew as they struggled to escape through sealed doors and windows.

Alonso, known for his composure, urged them to stick together and search for clues. In a long-forgotten room, Julie spotted a peculiar pattern on the wallpaper-symbols intertwined with vines. Alonso recognized them as protection symbols against malevolent spirits. Paul suggested they recreate the pattern with objects found in the room. As they arranged old books, furniture, and tattered curtains, the symbols began to glow faintly. In an instant, the mansion fell into an eerie silence, and the oppressive atmosphere lifted. They found themselves outside, bathed in the light of dawn. Their ordeal had come to an end. The haunted mansion had released its grip. The bond among the six friends had grown stronger through the harrowing experience. They made a pact never to speak of it again, carrying with them the secret of the mansion that they had uncovered.
